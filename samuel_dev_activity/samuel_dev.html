    <h2>Beginnings</h2>
    <div class = "paragraphDiv">
    <p>
        The story of how I started working on my first video game starts in my 7th grade year of school when I learned how to make games in Scratch. 
        Back then, I made a few arcade-style games to show to my friends, and I still have fond memories of showing each new, 
        buggy game I made for them. After that, though, I did almost nothing related to computer science, as I had decided early into high school 
        that I wanted to pursue a degree in pharmacy, so after I graduated, I applied for Ouachita Baptist University's pre-pharmacy track. 
        However, I quickly changed my mind after underperforming in my freshman-level chemistry class. 
        After some deliberation, I decided to sign up for the introductory class for 
        Ouachita's computer science track. While taking that class, I quickly discovered that I truly enjoyed working with computers, 
        and I decided to stay on the computer science track to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
        AFter I officially changed my major, I started to seriously consider the possibility of making my own video game to 
        publish online. Then one day, in February of 2023, I came up with the
        peculiar idea to create a character who uses her hair like a paintbrush, so I sat down and drew my first
        sketches of the character, thus Candace, the creative-minded girl with a penchant
        for painting was born. I believe I drew a sketch of a similar character some time before, 
        but that sketch has since been lost.
    </p>
    <div class="imageDiv">
        <img src="candace_original_sketches.jpg" alt="A pencil-drawn cartoon of a girl in paint-stained clothes.
        Also shown is the girl raising her hair off her face,
        and hair braided like a paintbrush tip.
        Above are listed her statistics: Age: 12; Sex: F; Height: 5 feet.
        The image also features various notes: Long hair for painting; Bulky white shirt; Dark athletic shorts;
        Shoes because I can't draw feet; Potential hair braid?"
        width = "1320" height="640">
        <div class="captionDiv" id="originalSketch">
            <p>
                My first ever sketch of my game's protagonist, Candace. The premise behind her original design was to 
                exemplify her affinity for paint by giving her an outfit that she might wear when painting, and I decided that 
                giving her hair that is long enough for her to handle it like a large painbrush 
                would not only serve this purpose, but it would also give her design a 
                defining trait that helps make it memorable.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="halfScreen">
    <p>
        My very first design for Candace featured her in a relatively plain outfit, but I later
        had the idea to draw for her an outfit that I imagined she would wear more often in public,
        and that is how I landed on the design with the braided hair and overalls.
        While I stand by my original design for her being good, I have ultimately decided to use
        the alternative design in the game. However, I may later implement her original outfit as a 
        cosmetic item and/or for certain cutscenes.
    </p>
        <div class="imageDiv">
            <img src="candace_alt_outfit.jpg" alt="A front and back view of Candace in her alternate outfit. The notes read as follows: 
            Overalls; white striped shirt; lighter colored shoes; braided hair; tip resembling paintbrush."

            <div class="captionDiv">
                <p id="altOutfit">
                    Candace's new outfit. When brainstorming what a public outfit for Candace would look like, I imagined what someone from 
                    where I grew up would wear. Unfortunately, I was not very practiced at drawing braids at the time, so that is definitely 
                    the first thing I would try to improve about this design.

                <p>
                    Ditto, in color. I decided on green and white for the colors of her shirt because I liked how they matched her eye color, 
                    as well as how well they melded with the colors of her overalls and hair.
                </p>

<h2>Inspirations</h2>
    <div class="paragraphDiv">
        <p>
            Perhaps the greatest sources of inspiration for how I wanted the game to play were Celeste and
            the Donkey Kong Country series. In Celeste, your character feels very mobile, and you are able
            to zoom from screen to screen at blistering speeds by combining various movement abilites,
            but it takes pinpoint precision to avoid losing control of your character and hitting an obstacle.
            This system rewards players in a satisfying way for mastering increasingly technical maneuvers
             to shave minutes, seconds, and eventually fractions of a second off of their best times.
            Likewise, in my own game, I wanted to capture the thrill of blitzing through levels with precise 
            inputs, potentially letting players beat levels in ways that even I did not think possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way that Celeste influenced the direction for the project was its emphasis on story. I hope that 
            designing the game around a story that has Candace grow as a person will meaningfully add to the overall experience.
            While I intend to give the player the option to skip cutscenes for speedrunning, I want to give players the choice 
            to emotionally invest in Candace's journey, especially on their first playthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also drew inspiration from the Donkey Kong Country series, especially Donkey Kong Country Returns, 
            which I grew up playing as a kid. In those games, the player has access to a unique moveset that has applications in
            combat and exploration alike, such as striking the ground, throwing objects, or climbing certain walls and ceilings.
            These games also feature unique styles of autoscrolling levels that are uniquely memorable by how they change how your 
            character controls. Likewise, I believe that designing a moveset that complements the game's tone is crucial to 
            maximizing the enjoyment the game offers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another of my favorite aspects of both the DK Country games and Celeste that I thought would suit my own game 
            is collectibles and secret areas. In my experience, I have found that including collectibles that require a 
            certain level of mastery over the game's controls to obtain add significantly to the game's enjoyment by 
            rewarding players for their ingenuity for not only obtaining it, but also finding it if it was hidden.
            Additionally, I find collectibles fun to collect even after I have learned the location of each item, as the 
            challenge to gather them all again on a subsequent playthrough still remains.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in some ways, I particularly like the DK Country games' approach to collectibles, especially in more 
            recent games such as [DKC] Returns. In those games, bananas, the items needed to obtain extra lives, 
            are found that requires 
            the player to collect them all in quick succession to find one of the level's main collectibles. 
            In its own way, this rewards the players for quick thinking and precise inputs, and it has the 
            secondary reward of giving the player progress toward earning an extra life, 
            even if the player ultimately ends up not needing it. Bananas can also be placed in a trail to an 
            inconspicuous place on screen, hinting to the player that a secret area is that way. Not only this, but certain collectible 
            items are required to unlock bonus content, and I always enjoyed the excitement of finding out what new concept art 
            or other item I unlocked whenever I met the criteria, and that's what I hope others will find enjoyable about 
            a collectible system when I implement it in my own game.

    <h2>Early Planning & Development</h2>
    <div class="paragraphDiv">
        <p>
            After I had decided on a design for the protagonist and a premise for the game's 
            mechanics, I started writing down various ideas for abilities the player would be able to
            use throughout the game. Back then, I wanted to keep the main focus of Candace's moveset relatively
            open-ended, as I had not yet decided on minutia such as how much emphasis on combat the game
            would have. However, I knew from the start that I wanted to add abilities that would make 
            Candace uniquely fun to play as.

            Then, in summer of 2023, I began development of the first prototype in Unity, wherein I learned the basics of C#. 
            Thankfully, I had already taken classes at college about Java, so a considerable amount of knowledge carried 
            over to learning C#. I didn't make much progress on it, though, but I was able to program basic actions 
            for the player character, and I better realized how I wanted the player character to control.
        </p>

    <h2>
        Later Stages
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraphDiv">
        <p>
            However, the following spring semester, my computer science professor informed me of Unity's intent 
            to change their terms of service such that Unity would earn a small amount of money each time a game made 
            after the terms' changes was downloaded. This meant that at best, small indie developers would be forced 
            to raise the prices of their games, and at worst, games could be 
            'download bombed' en mass, draining a developer of money because people didn't like their game. 
            Even though the backlash from the public was strong enough to compel Unity to cancel all plans to change their 
            terms of service, many developers - including me - were concerned that something like this could happen again, and many 
            opted to abandon Unity entirely in favor of another game engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully, however, I was not so far into developing in Unity that I could no longer 
            pivot my focus toward learning a engine. While I was still working in Unity, I became vaguely aware 
            of the open-source game engine Godot, and I became interested in learning it after I decided to 
            stop making games in Unity. I became especially enthusiastic about learning it after my computer 
            science professor told me that he had decided to teach Godot in his Video Game Development course that fall semester 
            instead of Unity, so in the last week of class of the semester, I started learning Godot and its own unique 
            programming language, GDScript. I started by following the tutorial in the Godot Documentation on how 
            to create your first game, and after that, I got to work recreating my 2D platformer prototype that I made in Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following semester, when I wasn't busy with making games for my video game development class or other 
            classwork, I continued working on my 2D platformer prototype. During that time, I was able to further grow 
            my mastery of the Godot engine, and I was able to implement rudimentary versions of core features such as 
            level transitions and tilemaps for quickly building new levels. I also replaced my placeholder sprite for 
            the player character with my own spritework based on Candace's public outfit.

                    A screenshot of the most recent version of the game. I drew all spritework for Candace myself, but I obtained all other art assets

    <h2>
        Future Plans
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraphDiv">
        <p>
            In the near future, I plan to add more levels, graphics, and other features to make the overall experience 
            more complete. Once I have the game in a presentable form, I plan to publish the game to itch.io, and I will 
            promote the game's launch around campus to gather feedback. However, I may need to reach out to others for help 
            on things like art and music; while I can create passable art assets for a demo, I may need help to make more 
            visually appealing game objects, and I will almost certainly need to have someone else write music for it.
